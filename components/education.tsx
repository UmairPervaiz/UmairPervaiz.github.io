                        I have completed my bachelors in Computer Science from Bahria University. I studied courses such as
                        Computer Programming, Object-Oriented Programming, Applied Calculus, Probability and Statistics,
                        Artificial Intelligence, and Discrete Mathematics. These courses provided me with a strong foundation
                        in Computer Science, which was further enhanced by technical skills.
